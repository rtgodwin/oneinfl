Description: Estimates one-inflated positive Poisson (OIPP) and
    one-inflated zero-truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB) regression
    models. A suite of ancillary statistical tools are also provided,
    including: estimation of positive Poisson (PP) and zero-truncated
    negative binomial (ZTNB) models; marginal effects and their standard
    errors; diagnostic likelihood ratio and Wald tests; plotting;
    predicted counts and expected responses; and random variate
    generation. The models and tools, as well as four applications, are
    shown in Godwin, R. T. (2024). "One-inflated zero-truncated count
    regression models" arXiv preprint <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2402.02272>.
