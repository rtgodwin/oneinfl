The R package `oneinfl` estimates one-inflated positive Poisson (OIPP) and one-inflated zero-truncated (OIZTNB) regression models. When count data are truncated so that $y = 1,2,\dots$, it is also often inflated at $y=1$. The current standard model for treating such data is the zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) model. ZTNB fails to account for excess 1s (or too few 1s), resulting in biased and inconsistent estimators.

This readme illustrates `oneinfl` by reproducing and extending the MedPar results in ["One-inflated zero-truncated count regression models" (Godwin, 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02272).

### Load data

Load the `medpar` data from the `msme` package:
```r
library(msme)
data(medpar)
df = medpar
```

### Estimate one-inflated positive Poisson (OIPP) and one-inflated zero-truncated negative binomial (OIZTNB) models

```r
formula <- los ~ white + died + type2 + type3 | white + died + type2 + type3
OIZTNB <- oneinfl(formula, df, dist="negbin")
OIPP <- oneinfl(formula, df, dist="Poisson")
```

`formula` is the population model to be estimated, variables that precede `|` link to the mean function and variables that follow `|` link to one-inflation. `df` is a data frame and `dist="negbin"` estimates OIZTNB while `dist="Poisson"` estimates OIPP.

### Estimate positive Poisson (PP) and zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) models 

These are the current standard models for treating zero-truncated count data.

```r
formula <- los ~ white + died + type2 + type3
ZTNB <- truncreg(formula, df, dist="negbin")
PP <- truncreg(formula, df, dist="Poisson")
```
### Test for overdispersion and one-inflation

`oneLRT` extracts the log-likelihood and number of parameters in any two models estimated by `oneinfl` or `truncreg`. It returns the likelihood ratio test statistic and its associated _p_-value. It can be used to test hypotheses involving nested models.

#### Overdispersion

Likelihood ratio test for overdispersion:

```r
oneLRT(OIZTNB, OIPP)
```
```
$LRTstat
[1] 3305.341

$pval
[1] 0
```
We reject the null hypothesis of no overdispersion. Overdispersion is a well-developed topic that has led many to discard a Poisson model in favour of a negative binomial model. The principle extends to both truncated data (the ZTNB model vs. the PP model) and one-inflation (OIZTNB vs. OIPP).

#### One-inflation

Likelihood ratio test for one-inflation:

```r
oneLRT(OIZTNB, ZTNB)
```

```
$LRTstat
[1] 131.4165

$pval
[1] 0
```

The LRT supports the presence of one-inflation (the null hypothesis is no one-inflation).

### Test for one-inflation

Godwin (2024) presents a Wald test for the presence of one-inflation. Only a one-inflated model estimated by `oneinfl` is needed.

```r
oneWald(OIZTNB)
```

```
$W
[1] 469.1062

$pval
[1] 0
```

The Wald test also supports the presence of one-inflation.

### Plot actual and predicted counts

Plot all of the estimated models using:

```r
oneplot(PP, OIPP, ZTNB, OIZTNB, data=data, maxpred=20, ylimit=180)
```

which produces the following plot:

### Summarize the models

A custom S3 summary function for OIZTNB, OIPP, ZTNB, and PP models estimated using `oneinfl()` or `truncreg()`, provides output similar to standard uses of `summary()`.

```r
summary(OIZTNB)
```

```

For example, when the variable $died = 1$, one-inflation increases significantly, but $died$ otherwise does not effect _los_. Average one-inflation is 4.2% (there is an additional 0.042 probability that each person will stay only 1 day). Average absolute one-inflation is 0.068, meaning that some observations have one-deflation (e.g. when $type2$ or $type3$ equals 1).

To reproduce the results form Chapter 11.1 in Hilbe (2011), we summarize the ZTNB model using:

Taking `exp(ZTNB$beta)` gives the incident risk ratios.

### Tests of significance

Since variables are typically linked to both the rate parameter $\lambda$ and the one-inflating parameter $\omega$, tests of overall significance are joint hypotheses. Testing the overall significance of the variable $white$ for example, use:

```r
signifWald(OIZTNB, "white")
```

```
$W
[1] 3.725885

$pval
[1] 0.1552153
```

The _p_-value of 0.155 suggests that the variable does not have a significant effect on $los$, which is contrary to the standard ZTNB model.

### Estimate marginal effects and their standard errors

Marginal effects can be estimated at the default "average effects" (the marginal effect is estimated at each observation and averaged over all observations):

```r
margins(OIZTNB, df)
```

```
Call:
formula:  los ~ white + died + type2 + type3 | white + died + type2 + type3 
distribution:  negbin 

Marginal effects:
      Marginal.effects Std.Error z_value   p.value    
white           -1.258    0.7344  -1.713 8.668e-02   .
died            -2.189    0.3964  -5.522 3.343e-08 ***
type2            2.575    0.5875   4.382 1.174e-05 ***
type3           10.142    1.4663   6.917 4.616e-12 ***

Signif. codes:  0 `***' 0.001 `**' 0.01 `*' 0.05 `.' 0.1 ` ' 1
```

these marginal effects can be compared to other models estimated by `oneinfl`, for example using:

```r
margins(ZTNB, data)
```

Marginal effects can be estimated at the "effect at means" (the data is averaged before evaluating the marginal effect):

```r
margins(OIZTNB, data, at = "EM")
```

or at a representative case:

```r
margins(OIZTNB, data, at = list(white = 0, died = 0, type2 = 0, type3 = 0))
```

### Predicted values

Generate predicted counts from an OIZTNB model:

```r
pred(OIZTNB, data)
```

or from any of the four models:

```r
pred(ZTNB, data)
```

### Random variate generation

Random variates can be generated using `roipp(b, g, X, Z)` and `roiztnb(b, g, a, X, Z)`. For example:

```r
n <- 100
X <- data.frame(rep(1, n), rnorm(n))
Z <- X
roipp(b=c(0, 0), g=c(0, 0), X, Z)
roiztnb(b=c(0, 0), g=c(0, 0), a=1, X, Z)
```

### Generate the expected response

To evaluate $E[y_i | \hat{\theta_i}]$ use:

```r
predict(model = OIZTNB, data = medpar)
```
for example.
